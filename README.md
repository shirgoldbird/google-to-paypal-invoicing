# google-to-paypal-invoicing
Automatically send PayPal invoices when someone submits a Google Form.

## How To Use
Go to https://script.google.com/ and click "New Project". Delete everything in the editor that opens. Then, oopy and paste the contents of either MultipleItemsForm.gs (if you have multiple items for sale) or SingleItemForm.gs (if you have a single item for sale) into the editor. Save the file.

Go back to the spreadsheet hooked up to your Google Form. Next to the "Help" menu item in the top bar, you should see a new menu item called "PayPal Invoicing". (You may have to reload the page and wait a few seconds.) Click "Get Started" and follow the instructions on the "Get Started" tab that will appear shortly on your spreadsheet.
