# google-to-paypal-invoicing
A free, easy-to-use online story backed by Google Forms and PayPal. This script will automatically send PayPal invoices when someone submits an order for items from your form.

## How To Use

1. Create the form where items will be sold.
1. Click the "Responses" tab on the form, and then select the Google Spreadsheet icon. This will create a spreadsheet linked to your form.
1. On the spreadsheet, click on Tools > Script editor.
1. Delete everything in the editor that opens. 
1. Copy and paste the contents of either MultipleItemsForm.gs (if you have multiple items for sale) or SingleItemForm.gs (if you have a single item for sale) into the editor. Save the file.
1. Go back to the spreadsheet hooked up to your Google Form. Next to the "Help" menu item in the top bar, you should see a new menu item called "PayPal Invoicing". (You may have to reload the page and wait a few seconds.) 
1. Click "Get Started" and follow the instructions on the "Get Started" tab that will appear shortly on your spreadsheet.
